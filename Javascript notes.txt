Javascript

A regular programming language, easy to start, hard to master.
Allows to give some interactivity to the elements on the web.
Syntax similar to C or Java but with no types.
You can change the content of the HTML, or the CSS applied to an element.
You can even send or retrieve information from the internet to update the content of the web without reloading the page.

Inserting code :

1. Embed the code in the HTML

	<script> /* some code */ </script>

2. Import a Javascript file using the <script> tag

	<script src="file.js" />

3. Inject the code on an event inside a tag

	<button onclick="javascript: /*code*/">press me</button>


Syntax :

var my_number = 10; //this is a comment
var my_string = "hello";
var my_array = [10,20,"name,true];
var my_object = {name:"javi", city: "Barcelona"}


function say(str)
{
	for(var i=0;i<10;++1)
		console.log("say: "+str);
}

A library that makes working with the DOM much easier, using an unified syntax and taking advantage of selectors.
