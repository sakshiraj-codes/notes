HTML Hyper Text Markup Language

Allows us to define the structure of a document or a website
Not a programming language, it's a markup language, which means its purpose us to givr structure to the content of the website, not to define an algorithm.

A series of nested tags (subset of XML) that contain all website information(like texts, images, and videos).

The HTML defines the page structure. A website can have several HTMLs to different pages.

Basic Rules :

1. Uses XML (Extensible Markup Language) syntax
2. stores all the information that must be shown to the user
3. Different HTML elements for different types of information and behaviour
3. The information is stored in a tree-like structure (nodes that contain nodes inside) called DOM (Docuemnt Object Model)
4. Must not contail information related to hot it should be displayed ( that information belongs to CSS), so no color information, size, or position.

DOM :

DOM is a tree that is built by a browser when it reads the HTML sent to it.
Every node can only have one parent, and every node can have several children,so the structure looks like a tree.

Main tags :

1. <div> - a container, usually represents a rectangular area with information inside.
2. <img/> - an image
3. <a> - a clickable link to go to another URL.
4. <P> - a text paragraph
5. <h1> - a title (h2,h3,h4 are titles of less importance)
6. <input> - a widget to ket the user intoduce information
7. <style> - to insert CSS rules
8. <script> - to execute JavaScript
9. <span> a null tag (doesn't do anything)

Other interesting tags :

1. <button> - to create a button
2. <audio> - for playing audio
3. <video> - to play video
4. <canvas> - to draw graphic from JavaSCript
5. <iframe> - to put another website inside ours

HTML good use :

It is good to have all the information wrapped in tags that give it some semantics.

We also can extend the code semantics by addingextra attributes to the tags :

1. id - tells a unique identifier for this tag
2. class - tells a generic identifier for this tag
